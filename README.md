# Notes:
### Logger overview
- every time one of the lifecycle methods gets run by one of our two components,
we have a parent and child, we're going to see that happen in the console.
So let's see, we can pass new props. And when we pass the new props, we see our
console run through each of the lifecycle methods that happen. We can also see
what happens when you hide a child. We see that the component will unmount.
